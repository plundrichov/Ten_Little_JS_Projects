        “The word courage is very interesting. It comes from a Latin root cor,
        which means “heart.” So to be courageous means to live with the heart.
        And weaklings, only weaklings, live with the head; afraid, they create a
        security of logic around themselves. Fearful, they close every window
        and door—with theology, concepts, words, theories—and inside those
        closed doors and windows, they hide. The way of the heart is the way of
        courage. It is to live in insecurity; it is to live in love, and trust;
        it is to move in the unknown. It is leaving the past and allowing the
        future to be. Courage is to move on dangerous paths. Life is dangerous,
        and only cowards can avoid the danger—but then, they are already dead. A
        person who is alive, really alive, vitally alive, will always move into
        the unknown. There is danger there, but he will take the risk. The heart
        is always ready to the the risk, the heart is a gambler. The head is a
        businessman. The head always calculates—it is cunning. The heart is
        noncalculating. This”
